## 💻 Code Highlights

### Random Paragraph Selection

```javascript
currentText = paragraphs[Math.floor(Math.random() * paragraphs.length)];
displayText();
```

### Ghost Racer Logic

```javascript
const charsPerSecond = (bestWpm * 5) / 60;
ghostInterval = setInterval(() => {
    const elapsed = (Date.now() - ghostStartTime) / 1000;
    const ghostChars = Math.floor(charsPerSecond * elapsed);
    const ghostProgressPercent = Math.min((ghostChars / textLength) * 100, 100);
    ghostProgress.style.width = ghostProgressPercent + '%';
}, 100);
```

### LocalStorage Integration

```javascript
if (wpm > bestWpm) {
    bestWpm = wpm;
    localStorage.setItem('typingRaceBestWpm', wpm);
}
```
